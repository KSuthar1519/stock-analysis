# stock-analysis
Project to help Steve analyze stock data for his parents. Also for the programmer the purpose is to run the original and refactored code and analyze run times.
# Results
## The outputs for stock analysis for 2017 and 2018 remained the same as seen in the images below:

Also, when the refactored code was executed, the run times for refactored codes were shorter than the original codes. 
Run time for 2017 stocks (origianl) is 1.703 secs vs refactored code 0.25 secs
Run time for 2018 stocks (original) is 1.78 secs vs refactored code 0.62 secs
The images of the screenshots for the run times are also attached to the repository.

# Summary
## Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code
Advantages of the refactored code are 1)speed - refactored codes usually take a shorter amount of time to run and therefore are much quicker- which is one of the main reasons why refactoring is done 2) may help with debugging since the design is usually better and more concise 
Disadvantage of the refactored code is that it may introduce bugs or can become risky.
